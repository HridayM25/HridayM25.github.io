I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka. I am mainly interested in Reinforcement Learning, specifically Imitation Learning, Human in the Loop RL and Multi Agent Systems.

I am fortunate to be currently pursuing research in - 
1) Imitation Learning with Prof. Balaraman Ravindran 
2) Human-AI Collaboration with Prof. Matthew Taylor

## Survey on Imitation Learning coming soon!
