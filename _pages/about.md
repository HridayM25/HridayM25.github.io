I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka. I am interested in various fields like Reinforcement Learning, Multimodal Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphic Modelling. 

I am currently pursuing research in the field of State Only Imitation Learning. 

I wish to explore other fields like Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), Graph Neural Networks, Spiking Neural Networks.
